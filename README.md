# RocketFlight
Numerical Integration of rocket flight with varying payloads, and launch angles, with atmospheric model and drag

Uses preset thrust values at given times, which are then linearized and used for numerical integration.
Script contains options for composite plotting of data, as well as a plot animation of the flight, at a chosen launch angle/payload
